Perl Disk Indexing and Searching (Perl DIAS)
============================================

I have many external hard drives that have accumulated over the years.
These Disks are normally connected via USB or eSATA to my laptop and
they contain all my personal texts, photos, e-books, audios, videos,
software packages, etc.

So due to an arising need to quickly find the location of a specific
file on one of those disks and to eliminate duplicate files (especially
big ones) i wrote these scripts, which are intended for use on a Windows
system.

They have saved me a lot of time and disk space since.
